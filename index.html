        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I live in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Southwest Virginia. I feel at my peak when I can deliver a well-considered and researched product. Empathy is part of my design approach as well as my day-to-day life. I'm interested in type design, accessibility, and the semantic web.</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>I begin every project with tons of research. Then my job becomes honing all that information into a cohesive solution. Every conversation is an education.</p>

        <h2>Views</h2>
        <p>Creativity is a biased process. Together let's take a close look at who we're including or excluding, who have we have or have not heard from, who is or isn't invited into the process. Let's turn dissatisfaction into something beautiful and meaningful.</p>
